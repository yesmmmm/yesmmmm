🎨 像素诗人
# Peel back my layers and you’ll find Adobe Illustrator, late-night Spotify playlists, and a burning desire to make interfaces feel alive.

I turn abstract ideas into visual symphonies. Currently collaborating on a generative art project exploring AI’s role in creativity. Looking for partners to push design boundaries!
